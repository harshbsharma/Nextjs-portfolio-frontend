            Greetings! I'm Harsh Sharma, a dynamic Full Stack Web Developer üßë‚Äçüíª, specializing 
            in the <a className='font-semibold text-base'>MERN</a> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
            I'm currently in my junior year of pursuing&nbsp; 
            <a className='font-semibold text-base'>B.Tech in Computer Science</a>, 
            I've spent a solid two years delving deep into the world of MERN. 
            My passion for learning and hands-on experience in hackathons and competitions 
            have helped me to sharp my skills.

            I&apos;ve continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
            challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now,
            in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development
            journey, I&apos;m building cutting-edge web applications using
            modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs,
            Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more. */}

            Outside of coding, I find solace in the art of storytelling through cinema.

            impact of technology on our society and economy.
